# Countdown Timer Project

---

## Overview
This project is a simple **Countdown Timer** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows users to set a specific date and time and then counts down to that moment, displaying the remaining **days, hours, minutes, and seconds** in real-time.

---

## Features
- User can set a target date and time.
- Displays live countdown in a clear and attractive layout.
- Responsive and minimal user interface.
- Option to reset and start a new countdown.

## How It Works
1. The user selects a future date and time using the input field.  
2. On clicking the **Start** button, JavaScript calculates the remaining time by comparing the current date and time with the selected one.  
3. The timer updates every second to show the latest remaining time.  
4. Once the countdown reaches zero, it displays a "Time’s up!" message.
